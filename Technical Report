1 Introduction
1.1 Background and Motivation
Car pricing in Tunisia often lacks transparency,
leading sellers to misjudge their car’s value and
buyers to risk overpaying. To reduce mispricing and
improve trust in the market, a data-driven system is
needed to analyze historical car data and predict
fair prices based on a vehicle’s features.
1.2 Problem Statement
There is no clear or consistent method to evaluate car
prices especially in Tunisia and generally worldwide.
1.3 Research Objectives
• Analyze car market behavior and pricing trends in
Tunisia.
• Identify key relationships and patterns within
multivariate car data.
• Segment cars and buyer types using clustering
techniques.
• Reduce data complexity to extract the main latent
factors affecting price.
• Discover associations between car features and their
impact on pricing.
1.4 Research Questions
Are cars in the Tunisian market generally overpriced by
sellers?
What is the fair market value of a given car based on
its features?
2 Data Collection
and Sampling
2.1 Data Source
I got the dataset from real life examples datasets
web sit and this is the name of the csv file when
downloading it: “1.04. Real-life example”
2.2 Sampling
It’s a full population dataset!
2.3 Variables Description
List of the column variables of the dataset:
['Brand'
,
'Price
'
,
'Body
'
,
'Mileage
'
,
'EngineV'
,
'Engine
Type
'
,
'Registration
'
,
'Year

,
'Model']
2.4 Data Cleaning & Preparation
• handling missing data,
• detecting and treating outliers,
• scaling or normalising variables when needed,
• preparing the dataset for PCA, clustering, or rule mining
3 Methodology
3.1 Analytical Tools Used
Python (or R equivalent) for data processing, cleaning,
and statistical modeling
Pandas / dplyr for data manipulation
Seaborn & Matplotlib / ggplot2 for exploratory
visualization
Quantile-based outlier removal (0.99 and 0.01
thresholds)
Train–test split (80% training, 20% testing)
Linear Regression Model for price prediction
K-Means Clustering (k = 3) for grouping cars based on
similarity
Model evaluation metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²)
3.2 Model Technique Specification
Linear Regression Model
Dependent variable:
➤ Price
Independent variables:
Engine Volume (EngineV)
Mileage
Year
Model Equation:
Price=β0+β1(EngineV)+β2(Mileage)+β3(Year)
Justification:
Linear regression provides interpretability.
Used for predicting continuous outcomes (car
prices).
Easy inspection of variable importance.
K-Means Clustering (k = 3)
Objective: group cars based on key
numeric attributes.
Variables used:
EngineV
Mileage
Year
Purpose:
Detect segments in car market
Support pricing strategy
Identify cars with similar
performance/usage characteristics
📌 4. Results & Interpretation
4.1 Exploratory Findings
Price:
Strong right skew: a few luxury cars distort the
distribution.
Outliers removed using the 99th percentile.
EngineV:
Majority of cars have EngineV < 6.5
Outliers removed above that threshold.
Mileage:
Heavy tail distribution; highest 1% removed.
Higher mileage generally correlates with lower
car prices.
Year:
Older cars show strong downward trend;
bottom 1% of years removed.
4.2 Multivariate Results
Linear Regression Output
EngineV → positive effect on price
Mileage → negative effect on price
Year → strongest positive effect on price
Model metrics:
Low MSE → good prediction accuracy
High R² → model explains a strong
proportion of price variance
Interpretation:
Newer cars are consistently valued higher
Larger engine volume increases price
Higher mileage reduces price significantly
4.3 K-Means Cluster Results
Cluster 1: Low-end / Older Cars
Low EngineV
High Mileage
Older Model Years
Associated with low prices
Cluster 2: Mid-range Cars
Moderate EngineV
Moderate Mileage
Mid-range Year
Represent average market price segment
Cluster 3: Premium / Newer Cars
High EngineV
Low Mileage
Newest model years
Represent high-value vehicles
Interpretation:
The market is clearly segmented into low, mid, and highvalue cars
Training a price prediction model on these features is
meaningful because clusters align with economic
categories
📌 5. Conclusion & Recommendations
5.1 Main Insights
Outlier removal significantly improves
model stability and reduces skew.
Price is strongly driven by Year and
Mileage, with EngineV also contributing.
Linear regression is effective in
predicting car prices.
K-Means clustering reveals clear market
segmentation that supports pricing
strategy.
5.2 Business / Managerial Implications
For Car Dealerships:
Better pricing strategy:
Can price vehicles more accurately using
regression predictions.
Customer targeting:
Clusters help identify which cars appeal to
value, mid-range, or premium customers.
Inventory optimization:
Dealerships can prioritize acquiring models
in high-demand segments.
For Buyers:
Identify whether a car is priced fairly relative
to similar models.
5.3 Limitations
Limited number of variables (e.g., Brand,
Features, Condition not included).
Linear regression assumes linear
relationships—real markets may be
more complex.
K-means requires pre-defining number
of clusters (k = 3 chosen heuristically).
Dataset may not represent all market
variations (region, brand demand, etc.).
5.4 Future Extensions
Add additional predictive features: brand,
transmission, fuel type, condition.
Use non-linear models for improved accuracy:
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Explore hierarchical or density-based
clustering for deeper segmentation.
Deploy model as a web app for real-time price
predictions.
Add feature engineering:
Car age (Year difference)
Mileage per year

THANK YOU
SO MUCH!
I have used both Python and R, you can check both
scripts. The Python version presents the executed results,
the charts, the dataframe tables and statistical values.
The R code also can execute the same results.
You will find the dataframe attached with the Python
and R codes.
I hope it will please you and reflect the quality you
expect.
